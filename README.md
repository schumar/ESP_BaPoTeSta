#  ESP8266 Battery Powered Temperature Station

## Intro

Using only an ESP8266 (no Atmel AVR) and a sensor, it's possible to build a very cheap and power-efficient WiFi-enabled weather station.

## Current state

My prototype (using 2 NTCs as cheap sensors and an ESP-201 on an awfully big breadboard) is running fine for a few days now
(powered by 3 AAA 850mAh batteries). I started to design a "real" version in KiCAD, and decided to release this WIP.
"Release early, release often" -- so don't expect to be able to clone this repo and have a working IoThingy 10 minutes later :)
